And to Russel Sage Foundation and the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science for providing funding and institutional support to the projects.]

## Streaming Chats and Politcs.

---

class: middle, center

### United States: AOC

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/aoc.png")
```

### Brazil: Jair Bolsonaro

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/bolso.png")
```

---
## Streaming Chats

--

- **Video Feed + Comments: All in one screen.**

--

- Most of times: really fast and chaotic conversations.

--

- Popular among the young 

    - Twitch (Amazon)
    - YouTube/YouTube Gaming (Google)
    - Mixer (Microsoft)
    
---
## From Passive Consumer to Co-Creator.

These trends converge to broader transformations in the media market:

- Media consumption becoming more social. 

- Media producers encouraging audiences to engage with their content via social media.

- Dual Screening as the modal media consumption.

- Comments sections everywhere.

### Are we paying enough attention to these new trends?

### What are the effects of <a style="color:red">live broadcast with streaming chats </a> on the public viewing experiences? 

---

### The Effect of Streaming Chat on Perceptions of Political Debates

We conducted a large scale ''field" experiment that assigns would-be debate viewers to watch the October 2019 Democratic Debate

--
<br><br>
**Three main experimental conditions**

- Control (standard NBC broadcast)
- Expert chat (538 website)
- Streaming chat (Facebook)

--
<br>
<br>

We then surveyed the respondents before and after, and measured the effects of streaming chats. 

--

---

### Related Literature: Dual Screening

At least a decade of research in Political Communication:  Users engage **real-time conversations** on a second screen (Twitter). 

- Initial concern about "distraction" supplanted by thinking about purposiveness (Gottfried et al., 2017; Van Cauwenberge et al., 2015, 2014)

- Viewers decide how to allocate their attention  (McGregor and Mourão, 201)7

- Changes the emphasis on what is observed: **priming**  (Barnidge et al., 2017)


**Main Conclusion**: Dual Screening generates more online political engagement (Barnidge et al., 2017; Gil de Zúñiga et al., 2015; McGregor and Mourão, 2017; Vaccari et al., 2015)

## New Features of Streaming Chats
  

**Different audience, different technology:**
  
  - Who is watching the Facebook livestream of a debate? 
  
  - Chat streams at eye-level; only one conversation (no personalization/viewer discretion)

- Thousands of comments, difficult to follow, and one only observes nodes of the network (majority illusion). 

---
class: middle

**More cross-cutting information and shift from genteel (possibly partisan) broadcasters towards the garbage fire that is comment sections**

- No moderation in real-time 

- Lots of repetition - "memes"  

- Hard to self-select (decide who to follow) 





---
class: middle

**Priming a very different set of issues**

- Many are outside the scope of standard politics 

- Maybe good (elite primes downplay serious attacks on candidate weakness)

- Maybe bad (reinforcing anti-deliberative, discriminatory and even hateful primes)
  
---
## Theorethical Pathways

We use the “Mix of Attributes” approach (Eveland, 2003) for describing new media technology and theorizing about its effects:

We theorize streaming chats are particularly distinct in four aspects:


- **Frequency**: high volume of very short comments.

- **Content**: topics discussed serve as primes.

- **Context**: comments' composition leads to inaccurate inferences of overall public.

- **Toxicity**: almost anonymity and size of the comments are prone to high levels of toxicity.

## Research Design

---
## Research Design and Sample

Two-Wave On-line Survey in September 2019 through MTurk (following Gross, Porter and Wood, 2019). 

**Wave 1 pre-debate survey with 2352 respondents**

- Identified respondents likely to watch debate, have Facebook account, could watch debate on a computer.

**Encouraged 1095 eligible and interested participants to watch debate on randomly assigned platform.**
    
**Wave 2 survey with 908 respondents**

- Analysis focuses on 576 Wave 2 Democratic respondents (including leaners) who watched at least part of the debate.

- N= 204 (Control), N= 174 (Expert), N= 198 (Social)

## Text Analysis

To complement our analysis, we scrapped the comments on the three plataforms. 

- 300 Comments on Expert + 6915 on Facebook. 

- Perform Dictionary Methods Sentiment Analysis. 

- Labelled the comments manually to identify topics. 

- Deep Learning Models to identify toxicity.

## Summary

.pull-left[
**Main Findings**:

- Includes more frequent and more negative comments than expert chat.

- Creates worse viewing experience.

- May disproportionately negatively affect certain candidates subject to toxic, negative comments.

- May distort inferences about candidate viability.

.pull-right[
**Next Steps**:

- More research on the mechanism

- More Comparative Evidence. 


- More descriptive evidence about these news technologies.

## Well.. we actually do have a second purely descriptive piece about the composition of comments on facebook streaming chats.

**Bringing the Audience Back In: Connective Effervescence and Streaming Chat During Political Debates.** Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media.

---

## Brief Summary:

We scrapped the chatboxes of livestreamed Presidential debates on the ABC News, NBC News, and Fox News Face-book pages. 

Collected more than one hundread thousand comments. 

Use deep-learning toxicity models to detect the amount of hateful sppech in each of the debates. 

---
## The Machine Working:


---
## Levels of Toxicity

Close to 20% of comments are classified as toxic or insult.
