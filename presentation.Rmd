## Streaming Chats and Politics.

---

## From Passive Consumer to Co-Creator.

The emergence of new technologies has allowed media consumption to become more social.  

Users moved from being passive consumers to active co-creators. 

--

- On the user side: emergence of social media app brings the user to the center of media production. 

--

- On the supply side: Media producers started to integrate their products with a strong audience participation. 

    - Dual Screening: Encouraging audiences to engage with their content via social media.

--

 **Streaming Chats** are the most recent and powerful manifestation of new technologies allowing users to become co-creators of media production. 
--



---
## Streaming Chats

--

- **Video Feed + Comments: All in one screen.**

--

- Become more ubiquitous to media broadcasting in the last few years.

--

- Popular among the younger generations.

    - Twitch (Amazon)
    - YouTube/YouTube Gaming (Google)
    - Mixer (Microsoft)
    - Facebook Lives

### What are the effects of <a style="color:red"> streaming chats </a> on the public viewing experiences? 

---

### The Effect of Streaming Chat on Perceptions of Political Debates

We conducted a large scale ''field" experiment that assigns would-be debate viewers to watch on different platforms the October 2019 Democratic Debate.

--
<br>
<br>

**Three main experimental conditions**

- Control (standard NBC broadcast)
- Expert chat (538 website)
- Streaming chat (Facebook)

--
<br>
<br>

We then surveyed the respondents after the debate and measured the effects of streaming chats. 

--

---

## How are streaming chats different from Dual Screening?
  
  
- **Different audience**. 6 out 10 young americans prefer to see TV on streaming (Pew,  2017). 
  
- **Different Technology**. Chat streams at eye-level; only one conversation. 

- **More cross-cutting information**

- **Shift from polite (possibly partisan) broadcasters towards the garbage fire that are the comment sections** 

- **Chaotic Discussion**: Only observes a node in the network (majority illusion)

- **Priming a very different set of issues**




--

---
## How does streaming chat influence perceptions of political events?

Mix of Attributes: 

- **Frequency**: high volume of very short comments.

- **Content**: topics are mostly distinct from the ones discussed publicly during campaigns. 

- **Context**: comments' composition leads to inaccurate inferences of overall public.

- **Toxicity**: almost anonymity and size of the comments are prone to high levels of toxicity.

## Research Design

---
## Research Design and Sample

Two-Wave On-line Survey in September 2019 through MTurk (following Gross, Porter and Wood, 2019). 

**Wave 1 pre-debate survey with 2352 respondents**

- Identified respondents likely to watch debate, have Facebook account, could watch debate on a computer.

Encouraged 1095 eligible and interested participants to watch debate on randomly assigned platform.
    
**Wave 2 survey with 908 respondents**

- Analysis focuses on 576 Wave 2 Democratic respondents (including leaners) who watched at least part of the debate.

- N= 204 (Control), N= 174 (Expert), N= 198 (Social)

## Text Analysis

To complement our analysis, we scrapped the comments on the two platforms. 

- 300 Comments on Expert + 6915 on Facebook. 

- Performed Dictionary Methods Sentiment Analysis. 

- Labeled the comments manually to identify topics. 

- Deep Learning Models to identify toxicity.

## Text Analysis: Validating Theoretical Premises

### High Frequency

### Much more toxic:

#### Mostly Negative Polarity about the Candidates

## Summary

.pull-left[
**Main Findings**:

- Creates worse viewing experience.

- May disproportionately negatively affect certain candidates subject to toxic, negative comments.

- May distort inferences about candidate viability.

]

.pull-right[
**Next Steps**:

- More research on the mechanism (laboraty experiments).

- More comparative evidence (Does it replicate to other plataforms or other countries?). 

- More descriptive evidence about these news technologies.

#### Bringing the Audience Back In: Connective Effervescence and Streaming Chat During Political Debates. *Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media.*

--

<!--

---

## Brief Summary:

We scrapped (using Selenium) the chatboxes of livestreamed Presidential debates on the ABC News, NBC News, and Fox News Facebook pages. 

Collected more than one hundread thousand comments. 

Deployed deep-learning  toxicity models and dictionary methods to detect the amount of hateful speech on streaming chats. 

---
## Levels of Toxicity

Close to 20% of comments are classified as toxic or insult. 

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width= '80%'}
