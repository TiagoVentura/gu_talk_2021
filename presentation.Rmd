## Streaming Chats and Politics.

---

## Recent Changes on Media Market. 

--

- New media technologies <~~> Media Consumption and Broadcasting becoming more social.  

--

- Users move from passive consumers to an active co-creators of the media experience. 

--

- On the user side: emergence of social media app brings the user to the center of media production. 

--

- On the supply side: Media producers started to integrate their products with a strong audience participation. 

    - Dual Screening: Encouraging audiences to engage with their content via social media.

--

---
class: center, middle

### **Streaming Chats** are the most recent and powerful manifestation of these user-centered technologies.

---
## Streaming Chats

--

**Video Feed + Social Chat: All in one screen.**

--

Already widely adopted by mainstream media broadcasting: news TV shows, sports programs, and political debates.

--

Popular among the younger generations.

- Twitch (Amazon)
- YouTube/YouTube Gaming (Google)
- Mixer (Microsoft)
- Facebook Lives

### What are the effects of <a style="color:red"> streaming chats </a> on the public viewing experiences? 

---

### The Effect of Streaming Chat on Perceptions of Political Debates

We conducted a large scale ''field" experiment that assigns would-be debate viewers to watch on different platforms the October 2019 Democratic Debate.

--
<br>
<br>

**Three main experimental conditions**

- Control (standard NBC broadcast)
- Expert chat (538 website)
- Streaming chat (Facebook)

--
<br>
<br>

We then surveyed the respondents after the debate and measured the effects of streaming chats. 

--

---

## How are streaming chats different from Dual Screening ?
  
<br><br>
**Different audience**. 6 out 10 young americans prefer to use online streaming to watch TV (Pew,  2017). 
  
**Different Technology**: Chat streams at eye-level; only one, quick, and fast conversation. 

**More cross-cutting information**: particularly on political debates
---
class: middle


- **Shift from polite (possibly partisan) broadcasters towards an experience similar to comments sections**: short comments, memes, others 

- **Chaotic Discussion**:Hard to sort, only see comments in the aggregate,   prone to lead to majority illusion.

- **Priming a very different set of issues**: most of them do not appear on the public discussions. 




--

---
## How do streaming chats influence perceptions of political events?

<br>

- **Frequency**: high volume of very short comments.

- **Toxicity**: almost anonymity and size of the comments are prone to high levels of toxicity. 

- **Content**: topics are mostly distinct from the ones discussed publicly during campaigns. 

- **Context**: comments' composition leads to inaccurate inferences of overall public.

## Research Design

---
## Research Design and Sample

Two-Wave On-line Survey in September 2019 through MTurk (following Gross, Porter and Wood, 2019). 

**Wave 1 pre-debate survey with 2352 respondents**

- Identified respondents likely to watch debate, have Facebook account, could watch debate on a computer.

Encouraged 1095 eligible and interested participants to watch debate on randomly assigned platform.
    
**Wave 2 survey with 908 respondents**

- Analysis focuses on 576 Wave 2 Democratic respondents (including leaners) who watched at least part of the debate.

- N= 204 (Control), N= 174 (Expert), N= 198 (Social)

## Text Analysis

To complement our analysis, we scrapped the comments on the two platforms. 

- 300 Comments on Expert + 6915 on Facebook. 

- Performed Dictionary Methods Sentiment Analysis. 

- Labeled the comments manually to identify topics. 

- Deep Learning Models to identify toxicity.

## Text Analysis: Validating Theoretical Premises

### High Frequency

---
### Much more toxic:

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width= '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./fgv_pres/proportion_toxicity.png")

### Contains Mostly Negative Primes

.center[
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width= '80%'}

#### Mostly Negative Polarity about the Candidates

## Summary

.pull-left[
**Main Findings**:

- Creates worse viewing experience.

- May disproportionately negatively affect certain candidates subject to toxic, negative comments.

- May distort inferences about candidate viability.

]

.pull-right[
**Next Steps**:

- More research on the mechanism (laboraty experiments).

- More comparative evidence (Does it replicate to other plataforms or other countries?). 

- More descriptive evidence about these news technologies.
